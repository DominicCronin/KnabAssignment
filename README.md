## Running the project
This project relies on API keys being available in the configuration. Please view the [ExchangeRates/ExchangeRates.Server/appsettings.json](ExchangeRates/ExchangeRates.Server/appsettings.json) file and configure your User Secrets to provide the missing keys.

To run the project, from the root of the repository use the following command: 

```
dotnet run --project .\ExchangeRates.AppHost\
```
The output from this command provides a link to the Aspire dashboard, where you can navigate to the client endpoint to see the application working. 

## Colophon
Programming assignment written by Dominic Cronin. Although this repository is public, the
code does not have an open source license. If you want to use it for an appropriate purpose, 
I'll probably let you, but please ask first.
